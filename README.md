# 13-E-Commerce-App

## Description

This project is an attempt to create a program that will allow users to view & manipulate a relational e-commerce database using different routes & http requests. To initiate the application, users must first initialize & seed the database so that it can be available locally. Users will, then, have the option view, create, update, & delete product, tag, & category data provided by the database using different routes & requests that can be viewed in the demo videos. Each viewing route will provide all necessary information about either a tag, product, or category, including their relational properties. Users can pass in specific JSON bodies and send POST & PUT requests to add or update the database. Then, users can view this data again to see the reflected changes. This project was constructed with database models, seperate modules, and the use of a database connection.
